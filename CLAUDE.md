## Developing rules

- ✅ ALWAYS use /dev-browser skill for verifying UI or frontend changes

## Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents

AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:
- PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files

**Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**

**Recommended approach:**
- Create a `history/` directory in the project root
- Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`
- Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files
- Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning

**Example .gitignore entry (optional):**
```
# AI planning documents (ephemeral)
history/
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean repository root
- ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation
- ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired
- ✅ Preserves planning history for archeological research
- ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project

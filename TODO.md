MAX_RED_RATIO: 2.0,   // Maximum red when spending is 2x average
MAX_GREEN_RATIO: 0.5, // Maximum green when spending is 0.5x average

This is just a simple first off implementation. What are some good economic ways of showing deviance in economics spending? Think hard.

✻ Thinking…

The user is asking about economic ways to show deviance in spending, specifically in the context of their bank transaction summarizer application. They currently have a simple implementation with color coding where MAX_RED_RATIO is 2.0 (maximum red
when spending is 2x average) and MAX_GREEN_RATIO is 0.5 (maximum green when spending is 0.5x average).

Let me think about this from an economic perspective. There are several sophisticated ways to visualize spending deviations that are commonly used in economics and data visualization:

1. Standard Deviation-based coloring: Instead of fixed ratios, use statistical measures like standard deviations from the mean to determine color intensity. This is more statistically sound.
2. Z-score visualization: Transform spending into z-scores and color based on how many standard deviations away from the mean the spending is.
3. Percentile-based coloring: Use percentiles (like quartiles) to determine color coding, which is robust to outliers.
4. Log-scale visualization: For highly skewed spending data, log transformations can help normalize the visualization.
5. Heat map intensity: Use continuous color gradients rather than discrete color boundaries.
6. Box plot inspired coloring: Use the interquartile range (IQR) to determine "normal" vs "outlier" spending.
7. Seasonal adjustment: Account for seasonal patterns in spending before calculating deviations.
8. Moving average deviation: Compare current spending to a moving average rather than a static average.

The user is asking me to "think hard" so they want a thoughtful response about economic principles. Let me first look at the current implementation to understand the context better.

⏺ Here are some sophisticated economic approaches to visualizing spending deviations:

Statistical Methods

Z-score coloring: Transform spending to z-scores (standard deviations from mean). Color intensity based on statistical significance rather than fixed ratios.

Percentile-based: Use quartiles/percentiles for more robust outlier detection. Example: bottom 25% green, top 25% red, middle 50% neutral.

Interquartile Range (IQR): Color based on IQR multipliers - values beyond 1.5×IQR are statistical outliers.

Advanced Economic Visualizations

Log-scale transformation: For highly skewed spending data, use log ratios to normalize extreme values while preserving relative differences.

Seasonal adjustment: Compare spending to seasonal averages rather than global averages. Account for natural spending patterns (holidays, etc.).

Moving average deviation: Compare current period to rolling 3-month or 6-month average instead of static overall average.

Coefficient of variation: Show relative variability by scaling deviations by the mean (deviation/mean), accounting for categories with naturally higher variance.

Heat Map Approaches

Continuous gradients: Replace discrete thresholds with smooth color transitions using functions like sigmoid or tanh.

Diverging color schemes: Use perceptually uniform color scales (like ColorBrewer's RdYlBu) instead of simple red/green.

Multi-dimensional encoding: Combine color intensity with other visual cues (cell borders, text weight) for richer information density.

Your current 2x/0.5x thresholds are reasonable starting points but could benefit from statistical grounding based on your actual spending distribution.

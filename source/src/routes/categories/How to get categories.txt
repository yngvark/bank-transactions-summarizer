To get a mapping from Merchant Category to combined, human readable categories, enable this code
in statistics.js:

-------------------------------------------
d3.csv("/transactions").then((data) => {
  // Get unique strings from row["Merchant Category"]
  const uniqueMerchantCategories = new Set(data.map((d) => d["Merchant Category"]));

  for (const category of uniqueMerchantCategories) {
    console.log(category);
  }
})
-------------------------------------------

(I've previously copied these into categories from transactions.txt)

Then ask ChatGPT the below question. The result goes into categories.json. ChatGPT won't output the whole output, so I had to say

"You stopped, please continue. Include the last row, so I know you haven't skipped anything.    "

and then combine the output myself.

---------------------------------------------- CHATGPT START ---------------------------------------------------

We have a list of economic transactions that has a category in english, as follows. The categories are enclosed by quotes.

I want you to map the above categories into the below, human readable output categories (they're in Norwegian). The output categories are enclosed by quotes. They are also structured so that main categories have no tabbing or spaces, while sub categories are indented with tab or spaces.

The output mapping should be in JSON format, on the form

{
  "input category": ["output main category", "output sub category"],
}

An eaxmple is:
{
  "Grocery Stores, Supermarkets": ["Mat og drikke", "Dagligvarer"],
}

As for the mapping, I want you to do a best guess.
